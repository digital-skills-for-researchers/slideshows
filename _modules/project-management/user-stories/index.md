      # User Stories

  - content: |

      Card, Conversation, Confirmation
      Describes functionality that will be of value to a user


    notes: |

      AS A … <role>
      I WANT …  <goal>
      SO THAT…<benefit>

      At some point all of us have said wouldn’t it be good if you could do this (with the software you are using) That is the start of a user story

      As a vacation traveller, I want to see photos of the hotels
      As a frequent flyer, I want to rebook a past trip, so that I can save time booking trips I take often
      As a user I want to reserve a hotel room
      As a job seeker I want to submit my CV for suitable jobs
      As a customer I want to transfer money from one account to another
      As a user I can cancel a reservation
        verify that a premium member can cancel same day with not fee
        verify that a non premium member is charged 10% for a same day 
        verify that an email confirmation is sent
        verify that the hotel is notified of any cancellation

      Detail are added in the form of conditions of satisfaction or Acceptance criteria 

      Remember that not all stories need to be written in this format such as technical or constraint stories
      Remember the story text on the card is less important than the conversations everyone has about the card

      ## Story Estimates

      Small, medium, large

    notes: |
      Story points are arbitrary measures used by Scrum to measure the effort required to implement a story. It is usually a mix of effort, complexity and uncertainty that allows the story point 

      Once a story point is set for one story it can be used to measure the relative size of the remaining stories.

      Using story points allows teammates with different skill levels to communicate about and agree on estimates at a level playing field. A 5 km run is a five km run for everyone (size and complexity). But some of us will run it faster than others (this is the skill and experience factor)

      It is easier and faster to agree an arbitrary measure than it is to use one based on our own skill and experience and speed level. 

      This agreement makes relative sizing of stories much easier.
